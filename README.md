# EFâ€‘MMaDA (Early Fusion Multimodal Large Diffusion Language Models)

As soon as I finish implementing [LLaDA](https://github.com/F4k3r22/LLaDA-from-scratch), I will implement and refactor a variant of [MMaDA](https://github.com/Gen-Verse/MMaDA) but with early fusion, that is, MMaDA and the LLaDA module will be trained from scratch and jointly because in papers such as [Transfusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11039v1) it has been shown that early fusion between modalities gives better results.
